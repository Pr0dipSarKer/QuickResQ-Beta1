# QuickResQ-Beta1
Beta version has firebase,better form , location accuracy, better layout but limited functionalty.

Features:
Form immediatly stores location in format: distric, local area, address to any firebase you want to use.
I myself use this XD

Some layouts are of older version, implementing androidx system wide will solve this.
Edit: Will update when have time
